# Module-11-Assessment-3-
The script for this program contains a collection of functions that allow for interaction with a web API that provides access to a series of blog posts. This API can provide all posts, the most recent posts, or the most popular posts. The "init" function establishes event listeners for three buttons, which will request different sets of blog posts from the API when clicked. The functions "getAllPosts," "getLatestPosts," and "getPopularPosts" each invoke the "fetchPosts" function with a different "category" argument to request a specific set of posts. The "fetchPosts" function sends an HTTP GET request to the API using the "fetch" function, including the "category" parameter in the URL. It then processes the response and passes the data to the "displayPosts" function, which generates HTML to display the posts. The "setActiveLink" function adds the "active" class to the clicked button, indicating that it is the currently selected view.
